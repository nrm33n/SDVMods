## stardew mod dump

Here's where I'm storing the mods I make for Stardew Valley. Check them out on <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/users/154664358">Nexus</a> and ModDrop.

Complete:
* WeatherGod Mod - change the weather by cycling through each type of weather at a customizeable keypress. This is mostly a mod tool. 
* Umbreon Cat - turn your cat into Umbreon/shiny Umbreon from Pokemon. 
* Laugh Track - adds an ambient noise laugh track sound to play every time you die. 

Coming up:
* Gold Mod - fluctuates gold prices in accordance to real world prices using a gold price API 
* PokePack - just turn all the animals into pokemon with additional evolution functionality (i hope lol). 
* Laugh track update - triggers at more events. (thanks if u added suggestions on nexus)
